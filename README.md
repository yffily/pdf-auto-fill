# pdf-auto-fill

## Description

There was this form I had to fill out every month. The answers were always the same, but it still had to be dated and signed every month. This python script automates that process. You need a pdf of the blank form, an image of your signature, and the content and location of the text to write. The script then generates a year's worth of filled out, dated, and signed forms.
